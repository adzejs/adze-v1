# Unit Testing

When executing your unit tests you generally do not want to see the internal logging of the code you are testing; rather you only care about the inputs and outputs. To disable logs while executing your unit tests, within your unit test file you should set the global value `ADZE_ENV = 'test'`. This tells adze logs to prevent rendering for the sake of unit tests.

### Example

```javascript
// ----- Browser Environment ----- //
window.ADZE_ENV = 'test';

// ----- Node Environment ----- //
global.ADZE_ENV = 'test';
```

### URL Parameter Override

There may be a time when you are debugging in the browser and would like to set the Adze ENV without changing any code. In this case you can use the reserved `ADZE_ENV` URL parameter to set it.

```html
http://my-site.com/?ADZE_ENV=test
```
