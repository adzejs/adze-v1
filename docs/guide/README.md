# Introduction

## Why is this named Adze?

> Adze - [a cutting tool that ... is used chiefly for shaping wood](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adze).

Adze was chosen as a name for this library to maintain solidarity with the logging puns and to emphasize that this library is a tool for shaping the logs of your application.

## Why should I use Adze?

As you may already be aware there are a number of other good JS libraries out there to assist with logging. The focus of Adze is to provide a convenient and clean API, provide first-class TypeScript support, and to empower you to take command of your logs rather than pigeon-hole you into a specific way of handling them.

Here is a list of the features that Adze provides:

- First-class TypeScript support
- Multi-environment support for the Browser and Node
- Wraps and extends the entire standard API
- A fluent, chainable API
- Log Listeners for capturing log data
- Log annotation namespaces, labels, and other meta data
- Attractive styling (EMOJI'S INCLUDED and consistent across major browsers)
- Everything is configurable
- Enables completely custom log levels
- A global log store for recalling logs and overriding configuration (supports micro-frontends and modules)
- Support for Mapped Diagnostic Context
- Convenient unit testing environment controls
- Advanced Log Filtering
- and much more...

Beyond the new features that Adze provides you, it also wraps the entire console web standard.

### Here is a simple preview

## What does the API look like?

As stated above, Adze offers an easy to use, chainable API. To create a log you simply chain together an Adze log instance with a series of modifiers and then end with a terminator. Here's an example of creating a log with emoji's and a namespace:

```typescript
import adze, { createShed } from 'adze';

// Create our global log in-memory cache
const shed = createShed();

// Listen to logs that are generated and operate on them
shed.addListener('*', (data, render, printed) => {
  // if my log printed to the console
  if (printed) {
    // do stuff with my log data like sending to an API or localStorage
  }
});

adze({ useEmoji: true }).ns('tix-456').log('Example log');
```

The output of this would look like the following:
